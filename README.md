By developing an algorithm capable of predicting trip duration, we can easily forecast its cost by multiplying it by a specified tariff. Taxi services have vast amounts of trip data, including details like the starting and ending points, trip date, and duration. These data can be used to predict trip duration automatically with the help of artificial intelligence.

Business Objective: Identify characteristics and use them to predict taxi trip duration.

Technical Task for Data Science Specialists: Build a machine learning model that predicts a numerical feature - taxi trip duration - based on provided customer characteristics. In other words, solve a regression problem.

Key Project Goals:

1.Create a dataset from multiple sources.
2.Engineer new features using feature engineering and identify the most significant ones when building the model.
3.Explore the provided data and discover patterns.
4.Build multiple models and select the best one based on a specified metric.
5.Design a process for predicting trip duration for new data.
6.Upload the solution to the Kaggle platform, participating in a real Data Science competition.
